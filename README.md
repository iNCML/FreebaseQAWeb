>A demo of the website can be accessed [here](http://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kelvin/temp/).

*FreebaseQAWeb: The companion website for the results generated by [FreebaseQA](https://github.com/infinitecold/FreebaseQA).*

A website interface that accesses "QA pair-Freebase triple" matches which have been generated by the aforementioned FreebaseQA project and stored in SQL. The matches are displayed in a user-friendly format and the user labels the relevance between the QA pair and the Freebase predicate.

The website is primarily written in PHP that simplifies access to MySQL databases.

NOTE: The repository does not include the ConnectDB.php file that creates the connection to the MySQL database.
